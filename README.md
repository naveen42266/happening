# Event Booking App - React Native (Frontend Only)

This is a **frontend-only** React Native application for booking events. It includes features like event browsing, seat selection, and a simulated payment process. The app uses **Razorpay** for payment integration and **Cloudinary** for asset management. No backend is included; all data is hardcoded or mocked.

## Key Code Snippets

### 1. **Mock Event Data**
```typescript
// data/events.ts
export const events = [
  {
    id: "1",
    name: "Concert Night",
    date: "2023-12-25",
    location: "New York",
    image: "https://res.cloudinary.com/your-cloud-name/image/upload/v1631234567/concert.jpg",
    about: "Join us for an unforgettable night of music and fun!",
    crew: ["Artist 1", "Artist 2"],
  },
  // Add more events...
];
```

### 2. **Razorpay Mock Payment**
```typescript
const razorPay = () => {
  const options = {
    description: 'Event Booking Payment',
    currency: 'INR',
    key: process.env.RAZORPAY_KEY,
    amount: totalPrice * 100,
    name: 'Event Booking App',
    prefill: {
      email: 'user@example.com',
      contact: '9191919191',
      name: 'User Name',
    },
    theme: { color: '#7E2CCF' },
  };

  RazorpayCheckout.open(options)
    .then((data) => {
      Alert.alert('Success', 'Payment successful!');
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      if (error.code === 'Payment Cancelled') {
        Alert.alert('Error', 'Payment was cancelled by the user.');
      } else {
        Alert.alert('Error', `Payment failed: ${error.description}`);
      }
    });
};
```

### 3. **Bottom Tabs**

I thing bottom navigation is not needed here. 
I have handled in ternary operator

```typescript

                {
                    tab === "Home" ?
                        <HomeComponent navigation={(value: any, params) => { navigation.navigate(value, params) }} />
                        :
                        tab === "Booking" ? <BookingComponent />
                            :
                            tab === "Search" ? <SearchComponent />
                                :
                                tab === "Wishlist" ? <WishlistComponent />
                                    :
                                    tab === "Account" ? <AccountComponent navigatation={(value: string) => { navigateTo(value); }} logout={() => { handleLogout() }} /> : null
                }

```
